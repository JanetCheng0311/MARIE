**Audio Files**

- **Location:** audio
- **Contents:** timestamped MP3 files generated by the MiniMax TTS scripts in this repository (examples: audio_20251230_174023.mp3, test_out_20251230_171732.mp3).

**How files were produced**

- The files were generated by `audio/minimax_poll.py` (asynchronous TTS job flow). The script calls the MiniMax TTS API (`v1/t2a_async_v2`) and downloads the result when the job reaches `Success`.
- Typical payload used: model `speech-2.6-hd`, `voice_setting.voice_id` set to `English_radiant_girl` with `voice_setting.language` set to `cantonese`, and `audio_setting.format` set to `mp3`.

**Audio Cloning**

- `audio/audio_clone.py`: A script for cloning voices using the MiniMax API. Requires an input audio file and voice ID.

**Reproduce / regenerate**

1. Ensure your virtualenv and dependencies are active and `MINIMAX_API_KEY` is set in your environment or `.env` file.

```bash
# from project root
/Users/janet/Downloads/MARIE/.venv/bin/python audio/minimax_poll.py
```

**Play files**

- On macOS, use `afplay`:

```bash
afplay audio/mp3_files/audio_20251230_174023.mp3
```

- Or use `mpv` / VLC / any media player.

**Notes & troubleshooting**

- If a job stays in `Processing` or becomes `Failed`, check the scripts' printed diagnostics (POST response JSON, poll responses and Trace-Id / Minimax-Request-Id). Short test texts help isolate input- or payload-related failures.
- Use `requests.post(..., json=payload_dict)` rather than `data=` so the JSON payload is correctly encoded.
- If pronunciation needs tuning, consider SSML or phonetic hints (if supported by the API) or switch to a native Cantonese voice ID.

**Contact / support**

- If the API returns unclear failures, provide the `Minimax-Request-Id` (shown in poll response headers) and the exact request payload when contacting MiniMax support.
