1. **Name Error**: Original “陸雨光” → Edited “錢如光”; *unacceptable* – the original name must be preserved.  
2. **Phone Number Error**: Original “1872311” → Edited “17231”; *unacceptable* – the correct number must be kept.  
3. **Numerical Expression Error**: Original “第2節” → Edited “第二節”; *acceptable* – context allows the change.  
4. **Punctuation Chaos**: Original “啦，” → Edited “啦!”; *acceptable* – but style should be consistent.  
5. **Unnatural Sentence Breaks**: Original “咁直播室裡面繼續有我陸雨光、林志欣” → Edited “節目深埋繼續有我錢如光、林志恩”; *acceptable* – but the original meaning must remain.

**Brief Recommendations**

2. Re‑adjust punctuation and sentence breaks to better match the original Cantonese colloquial style.
