========================================

**Total Score: 78/100**

| Evaluation Criteria | Sub‑Score (40% → 25% → 20% → 15%) | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| 1) Accuracy | **32/40** | Most key information is retained, but “小智” was changed to “Miss”, and the robot names NOW and the white mini‑sea cannon Pearl are incorrect compared with the original text; personal names and locations are correct. |
| 2) Readability & Flow | **20/25** | Sentences are generally smooth, but there is excessive punctuation and unnatural breaks (e.g., “每日早晨，我會準時叫醒你，話你知今日天氣同氣溫”). |
| 3) Retention of Cantonese Tone & Colloquialisms | **12/20** | Most Cantonese particles are kept, but “Miss” and “台面助手型” are too formal; missing colloquial particles such as “㗎”, “咧”. |
| 4) Homophone/Phonetic Corrections & Typos | **14/15** | Only the words “白色小海炮 Pearl” and “台面助手型” contain obvious typos; otherwise it is largely correct. |

### Recommendations

1. **Keep the original names and product descriptions** to avoid arbitrary renaming or adding non‑existent robots.  
2. **Adjust colloquial wording** by inserting Cantonese particles like “㗎” and “咧” to make the tone closer to the original.
