========================================

**Total Score: 68/100**

| Evaluation Criteria | Sub‑Score (0‑25) | Explanation |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1) Accuracy | **18/25** | Most key information is retained, but several names, locations, and event details are incorrect (e.g., “三國洲部隊” → “三角洲部隊”, “硫磺島號” changed to “琉王島號”). |
| 2) Readability & Flow | **15/25** | Sentence structure is generally smooth, but some paragraphs feel disjointed due to excessive Cantonese influence and inconsistent punctuation. |
| 3) Retention of Cantonese Tone & Colloquialisms | **12/20** | Many Cantonese particles and phonetic transcriptions are correct, matching the spoken style; however, some parts are overly Cantonized (e.g., “冇人震驚”) and do not align with the original tone. |
| 4) Homophone/Phonetic Corrections & Typos | **3/15** | Main homophones were not fully corrected; errors remain (e.g., “琉王島號”, “路貝爾” should be “魯比奧”). |
