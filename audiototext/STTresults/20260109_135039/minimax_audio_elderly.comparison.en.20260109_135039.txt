========================================

**Total Score: 12/100**

| Evaluation Criteria | Sub‑Score (0‑25) | Explanation |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1. Accuracy | **0** | The polished draft contains no key information from the original (names, locations, functional descriptions, etc.) and is entirely different. |
| 2. Readability & Flow | **5** | Sentences are generally readable, but the content diverges from the topic, reducing overall flow. |
| 3. Cantonese Tone & Colloquialisms | **0** | The polished draft uses standard written Chinese and lacks the Cantonese colloquial elements present in the original. |
| 4. Homophone/Phonetic Corrections & Typos | **7** | No obvious spelling errors, but because the content is mismatched, ASR typo corrections cannot be evaluated. |

**Top 5 Specific Differences (Acceptability)**

1. **Completely Different Topic** – The original introduced a social robot; the polished draft reports a traffic accident. *Unacceptable*  
2. **People & Places** – The original mentions “小智,” “Nao,” etc.; the polished draft introduces “曲某,” “吳某.” *Unacceptable*  
3. **Tone & Style** – The original uses Cantonese colloquialisms (“呀,” “咧,” etc.); the polished draft is standard written Chinese. *Unacceptable*  
4. **Missing Key Information** – The original includes health management, weather queries, etc.; the polished draft omits these entirely. *Unacceptable*  
5. **Grammar Structure** – The original has short, colloquial sentences; the polished draft uses long, formal sentences. *Unacceptable*

**Brief Recommendation**

Base revisions on the original manuscript, preserving Cantonese colloquial style and robot feature descriptions; avoid rewriting it into a completely different formal report.
