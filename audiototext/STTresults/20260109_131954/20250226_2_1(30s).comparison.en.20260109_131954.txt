**Total Score: 58/100**

| Evaluation Criterion | Sub‑Score (40% → 25% → 20% → 15%) | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Accuracy (40%) | 18/20 | The original “陸雨光” was changed to “錢如光”, the phone number is incorrect, and some names and titles were altered, distorting key information. |
| Readability & Flow (25%) | 12/15 | Sentences are generally smooth, but the original Cantonese flavor such as “咧” is missing and some sentences are truncated. |
| Retention of Cantonese Tone & Colloquialisms (20%) | 8/10 | “咧” and other Cantonese particles are largely omitted, reducing the colloquial feel. |
| Homophone/Phonetic Corrections & Typos (15%) | 10/15 | Some homophones were corrected, but errors remain (e.g., “廣大” should be “港大”). |

1. **Name Change**: Original “陸雨光” → Revised “錢如光”; *Not acceptable* – the original name must be retained.

3. **Title & Institution Change**: Original “港大經管學院副院長鄧希維” → Revised “廣大經管學院副院長鄧希偉”; *Not acceptable* – institution and name must match.  
4. **Missing Cantonese Particles**: Original “咧” and others omitted; *Acceptable* but recommended to keep for a natural colloquial style.  
5. **Truncated Sentences**: Original “咁啊教授啊，剛才咧，有位聽眾觀眾咧都提到話咧， 就係今次預算案頭提出咧。” is cut off; *Not acceptable* – the full expression is required.
